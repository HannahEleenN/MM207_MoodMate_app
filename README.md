\# MoodMate - Interactive Emotion Journal



MoodMate is a full-stack Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for children (ages 6-7) to identify, log, and resolve emotions. Based on a multimedia research prototype, this app bridges the gap between emotional learning and digital journaling.



\## Project Features

\- \*\*Client:\*\* PWA-enabled interface for children (icon-based) and parents (data-driven).

\- \*\*Server:\*\* Node.js Express server handling a REST'ish API.

\- \*\*Database:\*\* PostgreSQL for persistent storage of user accounts and emotion logs.

\- \*\*Offline Functionality:\*\* Service workers allow logging feelings even without internet access.



\## Feature Map

1\. \*\*User Accounts:\*\* Secure login for children and parents.

2\. \*\*Create Entry:\*\* Child selects a core emotion (Glad, Sad, Angry, etc.) and a visual reason.

3\. \*\*Modify Entry:\*\* Child can update logs with "Solutions" (e.g., "Got a hug") later.

4\. \*\*Parent Dashboard:\*\* Insights and advice for parents based on the child's logs.
